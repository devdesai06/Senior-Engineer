Build a production-ready React frontend for a gamified learning platform that converts a YouTube playlist into a structured, enforced learning path.

TECH STACK:
- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern React hooks
- Clean, scalable folder structure
- No placeholder code, everything functional

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

1. Playlist Input Page
- Input field for YouTube playlist URL
- Validate playlist URL format
- Submit button
- Loading state while playlist is processed
- Error handling UI

2. Learning Path Page
- Display playlist title
- List all videos vertically as steps
- Only the first video is unlocked initially
- Locked videos must appear disabled with a lock icon
- Show overall completion percentage at top

3. Video Player Section
- Embed YouTube video using YouTube IFrame API
- Disable related videos, autoplay, comments
- Detect when video finishes playing
- After completion, enable "Take Quiz" button

4. Quiz Flow
- Show 5 MCQs generated for the current video
- One question at a time
- Prevent skipping questions
- Submit quiz at end
- Calculate score immediately
- Show explanations after submission

5. Progression Enforcement
- If score >= 80%:
  - Unlock next video
  - Award XP
  - Show success modal
- If score < 80%:
  - Show failure message
  - Allow quiz retry
  - Do NOT unlock next video

6. Gamification System
- XP counter always visible
- Level indicator derived from XP
- Progress bar showing XP to next level
- XP calculation rules:
  - Video completed: +20 XP
  - Quiz score 80–89%: +30 XP
  - Quiz score 90–100%: +50 XP

7. Leaderboard (IMPORTANT)
- Leaderboard screen or sidebar
- Shows top learners ranked by XP
- Displays:
  - Rank
  - Username
  - Level
  - Total XP

9. UX Constraints (VERY IMPORTANT)
- User must NOT:
  - Skip to next video

10. Code Quality
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Reusable components:
  - VideoCard
  - YouTubePlayer
  - Quiz
  - ProgressBar
  - Leaderboard
- Clean separation of concerns
- Polished UI suitable for hackathon demo

DELIVERABLES:

FOCUS:
This product enforces learning discipline using progression, quizzes, and competitive gamification.
